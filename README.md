# snake-game-c-progam
This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in the C programming language using a console interface. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food items randomly placed on the board. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

This project enhances understanding of:

2D arrays,

Basic game logic,

Collision detection,

Keyboard input handling (_getch()),

Use of loops and conditionals,

Procedural programming in C.
