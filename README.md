# snake-game-c-progam
This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in the C programming language using a console interface. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food items randomly placed on the board.

2D arrays,

Basic game logic,

Collision detection,

Keyboard input handling (_getch()),

Use of loops and conditionals,

Procedural programming in C.
